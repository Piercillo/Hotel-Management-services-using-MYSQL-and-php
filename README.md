### Accountability 
   Each Hotel employee has to login using his credentials and as session is created with every login, Accountability is achieved. This feature plays an important role when payments are taken into consideration.

### Verification
   Every operation on the website must wait for verification by the Admin, i.e. Upon filling the registration form every user must wait for the admin to verify, check the privileges and confirm his/her registration to the site. 
   Every food order and room allotment request will be stored in queue for the admin to verify and confirm the request and allot the resources requested.
